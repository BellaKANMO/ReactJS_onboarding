# My React Learning Journey

I'm learning React step by step by building and modifying this app.
This app is build with Vite.

## What I'm Building

A simple image gallery that I'll improve as I learn new React concepts.

## What I've Learned So Far

### Done
- **Components** - Breaking UI into pieces
- **useState** - Managing data that changes
- **useEffect** - Doing things when component updates
- **useRef** - Working with DOM elements
- **Event handling** - Making things interactive

### Next Steps
- Custom hooks
- React Router for navigation
- API calls

## Quick Start

```bash
cd App
npm install
npm run dev
```
## Downloads
``` 
NodeJS
VSCode
Java JDK
```
## Quick Component tree
```

App/
├── src/
│   └── App.jsx          # My gallery component
├── public/images/       # My pictures
└── package.json
```
